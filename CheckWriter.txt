Assignment:	CheckWriter
Submit:  electronic copy.
Create a program that creates a Class that EXTENDS the built-in Ruby class Float.  That is will reopen the class to add
your own definition of a new method that will be available to all of the float numbers.
Your class should implement ONLY the following method:
	to_check_string
You may have additional PRIVATE methods in your class if you wish.

The method “to_check_string” will return a string which represents the Float number as a check writing string.
For instance, 10,234.44  when converted will result in the string:  “ten thousand two hundred thirty four dollars and forty four cents”.
This should work for any number between 0.00 and 999,999.99
Because the CheckWriter class inherits all the attributes and methods of a Float, your main program should be able to ask
for a number from the user and return the printed string.  It should also be able to add numbers together and print out the check string as a result.
For instance this code should work:
(10.25 + 40.30).to_check_string
should result in the following string:
"Fifty dollars and fifty-five cents"

You must submit your program with the name as follows so that my testing program will work with it as well.
In addition you must submit a copy of the testing program along with your checkwriter program.
	checkwriter.rb  (Your program)
	test_check.rb   (My testing program)
